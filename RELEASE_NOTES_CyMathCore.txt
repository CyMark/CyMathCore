CyMathCore RELEASE NOTES
Date: 18 March 2019

The purpose of this library is to provide mathematics constructs and processing for special mathematics needs
This is a conversion of .Net 4.6.1 to .NetCore of "CyMath RELEASE V1.6 BUILD 7 Revision 98".  It is intended to extend this
library to contain things like PrimeCalc (From MathView).

Platform: .Net 5.0
Repositor:  GitHub CyMark\CyMathCore
Dependencies:  None


CyMathCore RELEASE V2.0 BUILD 8 Revision 99
Date: 10 August 2020
- Get ready for GitHub


CyMathCore RELEASE V2.0 BUILD 8 Revision 100
Date: 10 August 2020
- Transfer from .Net Framework classes:
- ByteResult, IntVL, MathVL
- Test Project XUnitTestCyMath
	- XTestByteResult class


CyMathCore RELEASE V2.0 BUILD 8 Revision 101
Date: 10 August 2020
- XTestByteResult:
	- ByteResult_Subtraction, ByteResult_Addition, ByteResultMultiplication, ByteResult_Subtraction, 
- XTestIntVL:
	- IntVL_Construction, IntVL_Parse, IntVL_ParseLong


CyMathCore RELEASE V2.0 BUILD 8 Revision 102
Date: 15 August 2020
- XTestIntVL:
	- More testing:
		- Division not fixed yet


CyMathCore RELEASE V3.0.0 BUILD 9 Revision 103
Date: 3 January 2021
- Convert to .Net 5.0
- Added Number.cs


CyMathCore RELEASE V3.0.1 BUILD 10 Revision 104
Date: 5 January 2021
- IntVL:
	- DivisionVL using shifting and multiplying to caluclate Quotient and Remainder.
- Class Division Result to capture the quotient and remainder of IntVL division
- Division now works finally!


CyMathCore RELEASE V3.0.2 BUILD 11 Revision 105
Date: 11 January 2021
- IntVL:
	- Operator %  (modulus)
- Class EratosthenesVL for finding primes
- Classes imported: PrimeCalc and PrimeTuple
	- This still needs to be converted to IntVL


CyMathCore RELEASE V3.1 BUILD 12 Revision 106
Date: 16 January 2022
- PrimeCalc:
	- Enable loading of PrimeList
- ComplexNumber.  New class


CyMathCore RELEASE V3.2 BUILD 13 Revision 107
Date: 1 April 2022
- IntVL:
	- Fix Remainder of division if numerator < denominator
	- More test on modulus
	- New method: Digital Root (sum of digits - range of 0-9, with 0 only appearing for 0)
- PrimeCalc:
	- Modify this calculation as per: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_test
	- Can no longer use the auto list building like the sieve.
	- TODO: Check Proper working of Prime factors.


CyMathCore RELEASE V3.2 BUILD 13 Revision 108
Date: 2 April 2022
- PrimeCalc:
	- Seems like all the PrimeCalc actions are working now.


CyMathCore RELEASE V3.3 BUILD 14 Revision 109
Date: 4 June 2022
- ComplexNumber:
	- Add divide operaror
	- Add Complex Conjugate
- Statistics:
	- New class for statistical calculations
	- Normal Distribution
	- Inverse not working yet
